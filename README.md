# Simple MTG life counter

I would like to introduce you to my simple MTG life counter. I wrote it for my own use, and since I'm new to MTG, it doesn't have a lot of things needed for serious players.

Here is the online version, it is assumed that you can open it on your phone and put your phone between the players:

Of course, I'm aware that there are great apps like LifeTap and WotC Companion, but I love creating websites, and this was most likely just training.

I would be glad if this is useful to someone.
